# Wi‑Fi AP Hunter 📡

A Windows PowerShell “walk‑to‑find” Wi‑Fi AP locator that forces fresh scans, groups radios by AP mask, and shows live signal graphs + trend HUD to help you physically locate access points faster.

> Built for field work: walk slowly, watch the trend, and follow the strongest BSSID (or grouped AP mask).

---

## Features

- **Forces fresh Wi‑Fi scans** using Windows WLAN API (`WlanScan`) — avoids stale `netsh` cache.
- **BSSID tracking** with per‑radio history + peak signal.
- **AP grouping (Collapsed mode)** by mask (first 4 octets) so radios from the same AP stay together.
- **Live 3‑panel graphs (Collapsed)**:
  - **Collapsed panel:** mask max history (single dot series)
  - **Top1:** strongest BSSID graph
  - **Top2:** second strongest BSSID graph
- **HUD / status** with trend arrows and “VERY HOT” indicator at 100%.
- **Field-friendly**: fast refresh, minimal flicker, console title set to `Wi‑Fi AP Hunter 📡`.

## Requirements

- **Windows 10/11**
- **PowerShell 5.1+** (Windows PowerShell)  
  > Works great in Windows Terminal too.
- A Wi‑Fi adapter that supports scanning
